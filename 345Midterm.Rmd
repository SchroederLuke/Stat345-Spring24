## Introduction
The Purpose of this document is to show the Miami Heat's shot selection over time from 2010 - 2023 seasons. A shot chart was created in order to observe each shot taken by the team for each season. Using this data we are able to visualize trends over time with shooting distributions. Seasonal data was gathered by locating the position of every shot including who took them and the outcome of the shot.

## Shooting Chart Over Time
 ![](anim_plot.gif)

## Findings from this data:

 - Mid range shot frequency decrease drastically over time
  
 - Three point attempts increase over time
 
 - Shots in the restricted area have the greenest area
 
 - Majority of years the baseline jump shot has a high frequency over others
 
 - Less games were played in the NBA lockout in 2012 so less shots were taken
 
## Further informatinon on the data
 
### Mid-Range frequency
From 2010 - 2023, the amount of mid range shots has decreased dramatically as seen on the shot map. This can be seen as in the 2010 season, over 600 shots in the 15-19 ft range were attempted. Five years later this number was reduced to a merely 400 attempts. The 2022 season was even lower with a total of around 150 attempts from 15-19 ft range. This data is significant as it shows the evolution of the game as less shots were taken from a "less effective" mid range shot to a more valuable shot at the three point line.

### Three Point attempts over time
Inversely compared to the mid-range shot, the three point line saw an increase in number of shots over time. For instance the amount of three pointers attempted over doubled from the 2010 to the 2023 seasons.  Not only did frequency increase, but the percentage of shots that were made also increased. Superstar players in the NBA like Steph Curry have revolutionized the game in which the effects are easily measurable. 

### Restricted Area
Shots that were taken in the restricted area, withing 4 feet of the hoop had the highest density of shots taken each year, as well as the highest shooting percentage. This is because historically, the lay-up shot is the most efficient shot in basketball, so it makes sense why this is the most popular location on the court to take a shot. The selection of this shot has not changed much over time. This may be due to the fact that although the game has transitioned to a more three point dominant game, the restricted zone is still an important region of shooting.

### Other Interesting Findings
Over further investigation there were other interesting findings from the data in the shot chart. It is seen that the heat favor shots near the baseline from all distances on the court. Another finding is that years in 2012, 2020, and 2021 appear to have less shots taken compared to other years. This is actually true. In 2012, the NBA experienced a player lockout where there were less games played in the season. From 2020-2021 COVID-19 had an effect on the game where there were less games played than normal. Another interesting finding from the data is that from over years there seem to be shooting trends in certain years. The most reasonable answer to this is that players come in and out of the organization, bringing in their own shooting trends. In the year 2019 to 2023 there appears to be major increase in shots taken near the free throw line. What happened during this time period. NBA Superstar Jimmy Butler signed with the heat in the Summer of 2019.

The two graphs show the individual shot distribution of Jimmy Butler in the year 2020 and 2023. It is noted that his main shot selection is right near the basket and as he gets further away from the basket, his shot frequency decreases. This is different than many star players in the league, who tend to favor shots closer to the three point line. This may be a large indicator to why the shot chart showed an increase in shots near the free throw line since Butler Joined the organization. 

### Overall findings from all data
The findings from these graphs show there is a very large overall change in shot selection from 2010 - 2023. This shows the rapid evolution of the game, but also that there is more than one way to win in the NBA, as the heat have been very successful over this time period.
